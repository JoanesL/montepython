v1.2.4: - Fixed behaviour for the -all option when analyzing folders.
v1.2.3: - Tentative error message to catch a typical error appearing
	when running with a badly initialized log.param file. It now
	states that you should probably remove the folder entirely. It
	is not sure that this catches all types of situation, but it
	does catch some of them.
v1.2.2: - Several bug fixes. One with analyze module, that failed when
	a file was not complete (wrong number of columns) - fixed. The
	two other were more serious, and detailed below:
	- When using as an input a covariance matrix containing less
	parameters than the current run, wrong numbers were used for
	the remaining proposal distribution - fixed 
	- When running with *no* varying parameters, instead of using
	the values specified in the parameter file, the code would
	instead run with default Class values - fixed 
v1.2.1: - Planck lensing is now working
v1.2.0: - Added the Planck likelihoods (called Planck_highl,
	Planck_lowl, Planck_lensing and	lowlike)
	- Added a Cholesky decomposition method to speed up sampling
	for likelihoods with a large number of nuisance parameters (A.
	Lewis in Preparation, based on ?), which groups parameters by
	blocks of same speed.
	- Transfered the documentation to a sphinx-documentation. Most
	comments in the code have been replaced by docstrings,
	automatically extracted to create a web-site. You can now
	navigate the different functions, see the dependencies, see
	the source code in one convenient place.
	- Renamed both io.py and parser.py into io_mp.py and
	parser_mp.py (mp for Monte Python). It was conflicting with
	some installed packages of python, both being some very often
	used names.
	- Removed the comparison between input param and log.param:
	always choose the latest.
	- Changed the architecture of analyze.py file. The whole thing
	is no longer a class, but instead a collection of functions.
	To exchange information between these functions, a new class
	called `information` has been created.
	- Removed the common.py file, merging its content (lockfile
	system) with io_mp.py. Note that the lockfile is still being
	tested (works on our machine)
	- Transfered the log_flag from being an indendent quantity
	being exchanged between data and likelihoods to a proper
	attribute of the data class. Since no comparison is done
	any-more, there was no reason to keep it this way anymore.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.1.0: - Added the following likelihoods: SPT full data (called spt_2500 in
	the likelihood directory), compilation of BAO scale data (called bao),
	compilation of quasar time-delay data (called timedelay), timedelay, and
	updated the value for hst (1103.2976)
	- To speed up the production of plots, you can play with a new
	extension defining the print-out format: use the command-line option
	"-ext png", or eps, or pdf (from the fastest to the slowest format)
	- Added a lockfile system, that should prevent a file from being
	written simultaneously by two programs, when launching several
	different runs at the same time.
	- Changed a detail in the input file syntax, concerning parameter
	prior edges. To leave the prior edge undefined, you can still use "-1"
	as before, or "None". But if your prior edge is really minus one (for
	instance for w), you can write "-1."
	- Function cosmo_update_arguments() modified for better readability
	and simpler use (this function allows to rename or remap input
	parameters at each step before passing them to CLASS). The syntax
	pattern "try, except" is not needed anymore
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.0.1: - Removed the first and unwanted line of code/mcmc.py, that was
	pointlessly trying to import again Class. This conflicted in case of a
	non-installation of the Class wrapper.
	- Modified '0.9' in '1.0' in a print statement in MontePython.py
v1.0.0: Initial release
